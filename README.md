## Master's Project: Conversation Analysis

In this MSci project...

Specifically, we are looking at the structure of conversation under 2 different lenses: as a macroscopic trajectory through a topic space (built from the components of word embeddings) and as a string of microscopic dialogue acts.

Code for the Dialogue Analysis part of this project can be found here: https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/msci-project (Jonas Scholz' Github)

## Topic Segmentation and Embeddings
Steps taken so far...

*1) Keyword Extraction*

*2) Topic Space Construction*

*3) Segmentation*

*4) Preliminary Topic Exploration: Plotting*


Embedding techniques used:
* Sentence embeddings with InferSent (Facebook Research, https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent) for utterance-level analysis. 
* Word embeddings with Word2Vec for EDU-level analysis.

Segmentation methods used: 
* Infersent
* SliceCast
* Even Segments
