## Master's Project: Conversation Analysis

In this MSci project...

Specifically, we are looking at the structure of conversation under 2 different lenses: as a macroscopic trajectory through a topic space (built from the components of word embeddings) and as a string of microscopic dialogue acts.

Code for the Dialogue Analysis part of this project can be found here: https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/msci-project (Jonas Scholz' Github)
